Supported Payment Actions
-----------
Currently, this bundle only supports the 'Purchase' action, 'Validate' and 'Capture' are coming soon.

Extension Points
-----------
#### Events

BraintreePaymentActionEvent (aligent_braintree.payment_action):
 
This event is fired when a payment action executes but before the payload is sent to the payment gateway. It is used internally
to build up the payment payload and can be extended with other listeners to add data to be sent to the payment gateway. 

Use the `$this->getAction()` method to restrict Event Listener to a specific Braintree Action

Currently supported actions:
- Purchase (`\Aligent\BraintreeBundle\Method\Action\PurchaseAction::ACTION`)

#### Actions

Custom payment actions can be added by implementing the BraintreeActionInterface and then tagging the service with:

`{ name: braintree.action, action: action_name }`
